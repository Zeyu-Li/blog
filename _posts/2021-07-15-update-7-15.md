## Update July 15

Wow, it's almost been a month since the last update. Unfortunately I haven't been posting more updates because nothing much has been happening ðŸ˜¢. I've just been doing Leetcode, working my part time job, and doing some reading. The only thing down the line is the [natHACKS hackathon](https://nathacks.devpost.com/)

## Game Jam

This is the only relevant thing since the the last updated I believe and is from the Innovation's Game Jam

I called it *Attack from Above* and here are some screenshots

Unfortunately I did not win any prizes but you can check out the other game [here](https://itch.io/jam/ij2021)

That's it for now, peace out
