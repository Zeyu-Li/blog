# Update

Well I have been busy with my RA job like I previously mentioned. In terms of update, the job is going great. Part time is really good in getting some other projects into the day. Other than the job, I haven't started any new projects, just finished/updated some old projects and a lot of TryHackMe. Now I'm *Hacker level* and I finished the basics and pent test series.

Other than that, I have a few plans for an epic project while finishing the two ongoing (and outstanding in terms of "due date"). I know this is not a lot of updates but I got accepted to wizarding school:

That's all for now... bye
