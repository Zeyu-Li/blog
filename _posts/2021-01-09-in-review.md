## Review

Well this week has been turbulent to say the least, however, we wish the best to our southern neighbours. 

With that out of the way, I want to look back at what I did other the extended winter break (3 week break in total ðŸ¥³). During this break, I feel like I did a lot and nothing at all, so let's examine why that is. From the start of the break, I was hyper productive with

* resume/sv
* cover letter
* school course requirements (fillable pdf made in LaTeX)
* vs-code snippets extension
* updating website and GitHub index
* Fixed bugs in my repos
* Updating and upgrading some old repos
* Created this blog
* Started prepping for hackathon
* Created makefile template/tutorial

Then I feel in a slump a week before the last day of break for a couple of days. After I got over the slum, I finished 

* Implementing 204 algorithms
* Made a react-native project to praxis for Hackathon

And that leaves me with 2 more days till the end of the winter break. As you can see, it may seem like a lot, but most of these things are really simple and took longer than I expected ðŸ˜ž. I wanted to get more done over the break, but what can you do, time is an invaluable object. 

## Future

It's not too late to say what I plan to learn in the new year, so here I go:

* Vue
* GraphQL
* Electron
* Express
* Machine Learning (for school)
* SQLite (for school)

I keep it short for know since I don't want to waste time learning something if I'm not excited or invested in that technology. Anyways, I hope your year has gone well so far and I wish you the best in the new year
