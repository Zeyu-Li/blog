# New Year New Troubles?

It is finally the new year! I have been waiting a whole year for this day to come :p, but know it is here, I feel like nothing has changed! With that being said, I am very excited for the new year, in which 2021 is technically the start of the next decade.

### Winter Break

My winter break has been ok so far. I feel like a did both a lot and nothing at all. I did focus a lot of my time on implementing data structures from my algorithms course, which I find kind of boring. Nevertheless, I feel like I know a lot more about algorithms, unfortunately, it would have been more helpful to do it when I was still in the class, but better now than never!  

That's all for now as I am busy with many things so peace out ✌️
