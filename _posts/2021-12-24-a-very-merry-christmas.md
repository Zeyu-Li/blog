## Happy Holidays

A Very Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you all (assuming you are reading this around Christmas - subscribe to the RSS feed to stay informed)

As I predicted, it has been 1 month on the dot since the last update. I'd say quite a lot of things have happened but not too much at the same time. Firstly I finished school this semester and for the whole school year for that matter since I'm doing the internship for the next 8 months starting January. I've very glad to finish school for a while and to do so in such good standing (I'm almost at a 4.0 GPA) although that's mostly because I took 3 easy course ðŸ˜….

Other than school work, I have been grinding out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) this month. I have been trying to do Advent of Code in a new programming language that I've never touched before for every new problem. So far I'm 16 problems in, meaning I have 9 more to go ðŸ˜©. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/advent-of-code-2021) although I hope to finish all but maybe a select few this weekend.

### Exploring

In other news, I have been looking at TempleOS and its scripting language HolyC. The technical prowess is extremely enticing and that's why I spend the past 6-8 hours exploring it ðŸ˜…. I think I've done all for today but I might revisit it in the far future and for one of my AoC problems.

That's all for now, enjoy your holidays ðŸ‘‹
