Finals is over ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰

Well, it was over some time ago, but I have been busy learning other stuff. In addition I was wrapping up some projects. Lots of things are coming down the line, but are only getting started and mostly at a conceptual stage. Anyways, busy, busy for the next couple of weeks (mostly due to me doing TryHackMe rooms before it expires in 1 month flat :p)

Tomorrow I will set up my fall/winter school schedule so that will be fun. On the other hand, I did an interview for an RA position yesterday so I might be RA? Probably not tho, since I've never met another penguin RA before, but there is a first for everything ðŸ˜‰

And as always, say vigilant for the imposter:
