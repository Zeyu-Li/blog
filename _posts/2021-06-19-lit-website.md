## Lit Website

Well, well, well... we meet again and I have finished (mostly) (re)doing my portfolio (again :p)

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zeyu-Li/lit-website/main/public/preview.png)

If you want to check it out, go to [website-zeyu-li.vercel.app/](https://website-zeyu-li.vercel.app/) and explore. FYI there is an easter egg on the 404 page 😉. Keep in mind this website is not finished by the time I post this but I hope to finish by fixing some blemishes (+ some animations on scroll) soon.

## Other Updates

In other news the leetcode grind is going well, although I not enjoying it too much, it is the way in the land of SWE 😔.

I feel like I'm burning out at work but it's not too much since it's part time and I take frequent breaks. Anyways short update but I'm planning some big things in the future, so better finish some things and get ahead while I can. Wish me luck 🙏

I will leave you with this absolute cutie while I leave:
