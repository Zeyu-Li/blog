# New Month

Now it's Spooktober, it means more than 1 month has past since school started! That means the fall semester is more than 1/4 over üò±. While my last update has been recent, lots have been going around in the background. First I got another part time job as a full stack developer at @Zero RampUp, a startup focusing on DevOps tools. I've been learning so much on the job and even though I'm working 2 jobs and being a full time student, I've still got lots of time on my hands, although less so. This is mostly attributed to have 2 out of 3 easy classes.  

In other news my hackathon swag still hasn't arrived `(\*>Ôπè<*)‚Ä≤. I'm signing up to other hackathons for swag as well but maybe I should not even think about it since the hackathon from more than 2 months ago still hasn't shipped anything out or sent any updates. 

## End

Well I think that wraps it up for this update. Unfortunately I've not had a lot of time to make artwork so maybe next time
