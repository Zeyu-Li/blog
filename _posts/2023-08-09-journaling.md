## Journaling
Iâ€™ve recently started journaling and itâ€™s been great. Iâ€™ve been getting all my thoughts on notion and also organizing my notes (also categorizing inspirations). I believe notion has been one of the greatest tools invented because it is cloud hosted and has multi-media capabilities so I can check out links and images instead of just text based paper notes. Additionally, notion has cool AI capabilities to summarize each day. Maybe I can run it again and have a meta summarizer for a month or year. 

## Relaxing
I canâ€™t believe my internship is almost over as mine ends on August 25th ðŸ˜±. It came through so fast and ends in a flash. I hope to make a lot of these last few days. Overall it was an exquisite experience and once in a lifetime opportunity. From game development to prompt engineering and ML, Iâ€™ve covered a lot of ground in some eye opening experiences! 

## Barbenheimer
Recently I watched Barbie and Oppenheimer and I have to say, they were both slaps. I watched Oppenheimer first and even though it was 3 hours long, it only felt like 1.5 hours. Now Barbie was just pure fun and entertaining. Ryan Gosling was goated and was literally me (jk). 

Thatâ€™s all for now, this is my art after watching Oppenheimer:

Iâ€™ve become penguin, destroyer of worlds.
