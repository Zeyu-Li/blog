# New Year New Job ðŸ˜³

Well I don't know how to start this, but I just recently got an offer to join @[Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) as a SWE intern for 8 months starting winter! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ

I am so very excited to be joining them and excited to meet the team. I have heard lots of good things about them. In addition I've heard the office is really nice, along with the people! It just seems so crazy that at the start of the year I was unemployed and now I'm at a big company all in the matter of 8 months or so!

## Future plans

My future plans are to do the internship (obviously) but since I don't have to go to school, practice for interviews, interview, and many other things that concern going to school - this should free up a lot of time on my school for doing things I find fun like making more art and possibly making more videos.
