# Update March 20

👋 Hey, it's been a while since the last update. I've done some things but also not that much at the same time. Starting on March 12 and ending on the 14th was the [UTCF](https://utctf.live/) which is a CTF by the University of Texas. I did not partake in the vast majority of the hack and got 0 solves but that was because I was busy with other activities including a Calgary Competitive Programming Competition. For the CCPC I went by myself therefore it was challenging since I had to everything. I did learn quite a lot and gained some needed inside in what I my limitations where. 

The competition was also challenging since I had to compete in the higher bracket and since it was online, I had to go against students around Canada. In the end, all I got so a mystery random draw prize which is better than nothing :)

The rest of the times from the previous times were just midterms, assignments and other school work. This week, I hope to some things other than school 🙏

### Art

To round off the update, I must post an art piece I did

I call it *We Live in a Society*! It was made in Blender. 

Thanks for tuning in 💖
