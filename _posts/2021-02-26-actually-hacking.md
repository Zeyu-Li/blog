## Hacker Man

The past weekend on Feb. 19-21, 2021 I partook in a CTF (capture the flag) event. This CTF was online and hosted by the UCalgary InfoSec club. While my team didn't place well, I did learn quite a lot about hacking. 



Before the CTF I made a meme website for my team, `Capture the Bread`.

Here is the website if anyone wants to checks it out: [zeyu-li.github.io/capturethebread/](https://zeyu-li.github.io/CaptureTheBread/)



Your sweet bread,
