## End of Summer

Well it seems like the end of summer is quickly approaching, which means one thing for me... school ðŸ˜¢

Before it's over, I want to rate this summer out of 10. So far, I'm giving it a 9/10, probably the best summer I will have. I got a lot done and even though I wanted to do just a touch more things, I am grateful for everything I have done.

### Hackathon

I may have partook in another hackathon this weekend. This one did not win a prize (or at least at the time of writing this) but it looks very cool. If you want to take a look at the temperature visualizer click this [link](https://devpost.com/software/degrees-of-change?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)



Anyway, that's all for now from this penguin who will go back to school soon
