# A New Framework

I have recently been playing around with the T3 stack and "serverless" architecture and I have found it a great joy to work with. Recently for a hackathon, I created Coupon, a mobile first app that allows students to find coupons for their favourite stores. It also allows stores to create and manage coupons live @ [coupons.andrewli.site](https://coupons.andrewli.site/) while the source code is https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/coupon-jam. This was created from the [T3 stack starter](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app), a full stack framework based on Next.js, Typescript, tailwind, Prisma and NextAuth promoted by [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg), a ex-Twitch employee. This experience was very enlightening in how it made me see software architecture in the serverless flavour. All DB operations must call an external service (in this case we used planetscale). Now for things that don't require a stateful existence (ie those using websockets), I will most likely be using the T3 stack. In addition I have found that designing with Tailwind and Typescript (for the front end) is actually quite enjoyable compared to JS + BEM styling.

## School

Well, the swing of school is back in full force and I am not looking towards it. 2 weeks in and I'm already feeling burnt out. Alas, time moves on and tasks won't do themselves. I am looking forward to going back to work. 

## Things that get me excited

I think I want to keep this as a recurring section from now on where I explore something that gets me excited. In this post, I think I will go through the immense progress in the AI image generation space. As of a few days ago, it was reported that someone using image generation from an AI won an art contest and I am very encouraged by this advancement since it means we can get mastery level art from an AI! I feel like this is a great place for game changing innovation and startup ideas to generate from. I can't wait for the next generation of AI.

Here is a video that goes more into this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVhmFski3vg

Well that's all for now and although I am not a image generation AI, I have created this:
