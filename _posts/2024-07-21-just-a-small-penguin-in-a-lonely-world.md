After graduating, I feel like I'm just a small bean in a large, large world. I moved to Toronto for a SWE job and I am very grateful for the job. Recently there was a 10% layoff but I was not affected thankfully. There seems to be a large amount of AI work waiting for me so I'm not scared. In fact, I'm living the dream. Once there is a stable source of income and money rolling in every 2 weeks, there is a lot of freedom and funds to do whatever the heart desires. Building up habits is a huge area of focus for me. I've also made a schedule and written in my notion journal. Yet there never seems to be time between going out every weekend and following my rigorous schedule. Now to stop this from becoming more like a journal entry, let me hold myself to account to deliver new content and deliver for you. 

## AI

It seems to me like AI is reaching the top of the S curve and is quickly slowing down. Without a paradigm shift like composition of systems and RL based online LLMs, it is likely to not achieve scale prophesied by most. This is great news for ML researchers that are in the money for decades and decades to come and bad news for hypeman, trying to ruin the world. As we enter this new age, I say we squeeze the hypeman and capitalist that know nothing about the industry for every cent they have got. 

## Thanks for listen to a penguin

I promise more art, more media, a video or two and so much more. For now, I go to sleep. Tomorrow I will deliver AI ðŸ˜‰.
